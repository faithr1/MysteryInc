Hello, this is a project for CMSC447.
The purpose of this project is to be a storyboard that authors can use to write mysteries and build clues.
The first iteration I (Tony Cruz) worked on the login/sign-up page for the storyboard site.
A majority of my time was spent researching django applications and reading through tutorials.

Testing: the test for this project so far is done manually by the user. This can be done by running the login page application
    using the steps below and creating an account/logging in.

Run Steps:
0) Before any steps first the user must install Django 3.1.7 and Python
1) run the line "Pip install -r requirements.txt" in the terminal to download dependencies
2) cd into the MysteryInc/loginPage/ directory
3) run the line "python manage.py runserver" in the terminal to stand up web page
4) in a web browser enter the url "http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/login/" and proceed with testing the application
