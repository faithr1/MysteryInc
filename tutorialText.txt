Welcome to the Mystery Inc. Story Creator!

This is here to help teach you the ropes on how to get around
the site and set up your first story!

Everything you'll need is on the row of buttons above. Each one
is pretty self explanatory, but we'll run through all of them
as well as everything else on this page for the utmost clarity.

Title:           This is where you put in the name of your interactive
                 mystery story!

                 name you used to sign in.

                 forget to save beforehand!

                 then you can remove it with this button. This action
                 is irreversible, so make sure you're absolutely sure.

Refresh:         Assuming this just refreshes the page to show was is
                 what's currently still there and what not? (confirm
                 this)

Display Clues:   This takes you to a page filled with all of the connections
                 you've made between your clues (add more once I actually
                 see the page)
